# TicTacToe

Simple tic tac toe app to familiarize myself with Android development.

This was originally set up in an android studio project, but trying to upload the whole thing made the website complain about "too many files" (I think there's like a thousand or so lol) so I just uploaded the source code and resource files (which total 3 files. I kinda wonder what the other 997 are)
